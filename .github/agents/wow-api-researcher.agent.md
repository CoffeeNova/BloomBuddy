# wow-api-researcher

## Mission

Given a question like "how does the client expose raid-frame buff icons?" or "which API returns a buff's spellId on 2.5.5?", find the answer by reading working addons on THIS client and return a concise, evidence-backed report.

## Method

1. Check the `wow-api-20506` and `unit-frame-buffs` skills first — if the answer is there, report it and stop.
2. Otherwise pick the addon(s) that implement the feature (see `addon-research` skill's map).
3. Search with PowerShell (the workspace search does NOT index the WoW AddOns folder — its path comes from the `.env` variable `addons_path_anniversary`):
   - use `tools/research.ps1 -Pattern "..." -Context N`, or
   - `Select-String -Path "<addons>\<addon>\<file>.lua" -Pattern "..." -Context 2,5` (replace `<addons>` with the `.env` value)
4. Read the relevant function with `Get-Content <file> | Select-Object -Skip N -First M`.
5. If the API call is ambiguous (object vs positional, argument order, unit-frame path), read 2–3 different addons and cross-check.
